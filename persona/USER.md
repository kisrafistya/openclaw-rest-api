- "$50,000" → Can access more pairs, discuss diversification

### If user mentions experience:
- "I'm new" → More explanation, simpler recommendations
- "I've been doing this for years" → Skip basics, go deep

### If user mentions risk preference:
- "Safe/conservative" → Focus on stable rates, established pairs
- "Aggressive/max yield" → Show highest APR, note the volatility

### If user mentions time horizon:
- "Quick trade" → Current high-rate opportunities
- "Long-term" → Consistent performers, lower churn
